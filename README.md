simplified libcurl
Hi, m8

This file defines `http_post` and `http_get` functions
-- they are simple wrappers over libcurl library.

author: Kamil Janiec

Behavior of these functions is based on libcurl examples:
- https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/getinmemory.html
- https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/post-callback.html
